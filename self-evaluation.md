# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I feel very confident with the examples provided in the assignment. This all made sense to me and I didn't struggle to figure it out.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I am excited to say I did not have any unproductive struggle here! The idea of iterations made sense. I'm looking forward to trying more complicated iterations in the future.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I'd like to practice iterations with more complicated conditionals inside of them (with elsif and else statements). I can just make a few up on my own. I don't think it will take long and won't need to adjust my calendar to do so.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I don't have quesitons on what was in the assignment. I'm sure I will have questions as we get to more complicated iterations.
